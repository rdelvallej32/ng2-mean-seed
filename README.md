# Angular 2 Fullstack Seed Project

A quickstart seed project to quickly bootstrap a working
fullstack application.

### Tech Stack
 -  Angular 2
 -  Node.js
 -  Express
 -  MongoDB
 -  Webpack 2.0

### To Start
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build out the project: `npm run build`
3. To watch changes in your server files: `npm run watch:server`
4. Otherwise: `npm run start`


#### Note
This is still a work in progress for making a production ready application, but you can run `npm build:prod` and deploy the `dist` folder. I'm looking forward to adding a testing framework to accompany this seed project and other tools (i.e. Gulp, Docker, Yarn).
